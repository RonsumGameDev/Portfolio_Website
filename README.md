# 🚧 The Most Basic Website Ever

Welcome to the **most barebones, no-frills, barely-functioning website** you'll ever see.

## 😬 What's This?

This was a *very basic and terrible* website I had to make as part of an **interview task** for a club I wanted to join. Trust me, I know it's not impressive — but hey, deadlines and desperation are a powerful combo.

## 💡 Features (if you can call them that)
- An `index.html` that exists. Barely.
- An `index.css` file that probably changed a background color.
- An `index.js` that may or may not do anything.
- (Nobody names them index.css and index.js)

## 🫣 Warning

This project contains:
- Cringe
- Chaos

View it if you must... but lower your expectations before you do.

## 🎯 Why does this even exist?

Because I really wanted to join a club.

That’s it. That’s the reason.
